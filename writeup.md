# Interactive Shiny tool for learning causal inference
#### Joe Marlo, jpm770

## Introduction
The goal of the tool is to help students build intuition for key causal inference concepts via visualization. The tool attempts to follow a 'first principles' path by first describing the fundamental problem of causal inference and why randomization is often necessary. From there, visualizations of treatment effects, propensity scores, and regression discontinuity are included and all include interactive components.

The tool is currently hosted on my Shinyapps.io server and can be accessed [here](https://jmarlo.shinyapps.io/causal-tool/). All code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/joemarlo/causal-tool) and is provided with a GNU General Public License v3.0 guaranteeing free public and private use and distribution.
