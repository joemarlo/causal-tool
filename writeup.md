# Interactive Shiny tool for learning causal inference
#### Joe Marlo, jpm770

## Introduction
The goal of the tool is to help students build intuition for key causal inference concepts via visualization. The tool attempts to follow a 'first principles' path by first describing the fundamental problem of causal inference and why randomization is often necessary. From there, visualizations of treatment effects, propensity scores, and regression discontinuity are included. All include interactive components.

The tool is currently hosted on my Shinyapps.io server and can be accessed [here](https://jmarlo.shinyapps.io/causal-tool/). All code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/joemarlo/causal-tool) and is provided with a GNU General Public License v3.0 guaranteeing free public and private use and distribution.

## Fundamental problem of causal inference

## Randomization

## Treatment effects

## Propensity scores

## Regression discontinuity

## Conclusion

### 2.0 wishlist
- Treatment effects
  - animate simulation so observations 'fall down'
  
- Observational study
  - new tab
  - overlap and balance
- Regression discontinuity:
  - differing functional forms on left and right side of cutoff
  - differing bandwidth on lef tand right side of cutoff

1-2 pages
explain why I chose to display what I displayed and why it makes sense
should add a DGP to regression discontinuity that is difficult to model (some crazy polynomial)
should add mean lines to the SATE animations
